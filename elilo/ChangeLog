2005-09-15 Brett Johnson <brett@hp.com>
	* Applied patch from Tristan Gingold to add dcache flush and sync with
	  icache to gzip and plain loaders.  This ommision was just noticed now
	  due to the much larger caches in Montecito, and the smaller size of
	  Xen (as compared to the linux kernel).
2004-09-27 Brett Johnson <brett@hp.com>
	* Increase the hardcoded size of the texmenu chooser menu from 16 to 64

2003-08-13 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* fix a bug in read_config() where it would try other
	  filename even when the user explicitely specified one

2003-01-28 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* fix the set_default_path() routine in glue_localfs.c. It would not

	  elilo.conf not to be found sometimes.
2003-01-21 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* Changed the despecialization character for the variables from \\ to &
	  to avoid conflicts with \\ as a path separator
2002-06-11 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* fixed the return value in efi_main(). elilo was always returning
	  success even in case of failure. Bug reported by Egan Ford <egan@sense.net>
	* applied patch from Richard Hirst <rhirst@linuxcare.com> to fix an
	  initialization bug in choosers/textmenu.c 
	* applied patch from Richard Hirst <rhirst@linuxcare.com> to make elilo

	* fixed error in netfs.c where the kernel name was not correctly set in
	  netfs_query_layer()
	* fixed to wait_timeout() to correct the problem with the interactive prompt when
	  return is hit directly when no text

2001-06-28  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>
	* removed W2U() hack to get from wide-char to unicode. Use -fshort-wchar option instead.

	* added support for ext2fs filesystem.
	* restructured code to allow additional filesystems to be added easily.
	* cleaned up add-on chooser interface.
	* restructured code to use the EFI protocol interface to install filesystems.
	* added compile-time options to turn on and off specific filesystems.
	* added support for architecture specific configuration options (elilo.conf).
	* added fpswa option to IA-64 to designate a fpswa driver file.
	* incoporated IA-32 support from Mike Johnston <michael.johnston@intel.com>

	* added interface for custom device naming schemes (devnames directory).
        * added support for 2 possible config file (now just on netboot). The first
          (primary) choice uses a host specific filename based on the IP address. Suggestion
	  from Egan Ford <egan@sense.net>.

2001-04-06  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* incorporated patches from David and Michael Johnston at Intel
	  to get the package to compile for IA-32 linux target.

	* Fixed ELILO to compile for Ia-32 (does not execute yet, though):
	  Makefile and start_kernel() function.

2001-04-06  Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de>

	* Fixed config.c  to
	  get the timeout directive to do something. implemented the global
	  root= directive.

	* Fix the efi_main() to deal with the -C option properly

2001-04-05  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* update efi library to latest EFI toolkit 1.02 as distributed
	  by Intel. Fixed header + library files to compile with GCC

	* merged ELI and LILO (as of gnu-efi-1.1) together, mostly
	  taking the config file feature of ELI.

	* renamed LILO to ELILO to make the distinction

	* restructured code to make it easier to understand and maintain

	* fixed FPSWA driver checking and loading: we try all possible
	  files and let the driver itself figure out if it is the most
	  recent.
	* added support for compression (gzip) but keep support for plain
	  ELF image. ELILO autodetects the format

	* change the way the kernel is invoked. Now we call it in 
	  physical memory mode. This breaks the dependency between the
	  kernel code and the loader. No more lilo_start.c madness.

	* changed the way the boot_params are passed. We don't use the 
	  ZERO_PAGE_ADDR trick anymore. Instead we use EFI runtime memory.
	  The address of the structure is passed to the kernel in r28
	  by our convention.

	* released as gnu-efi-2.0

2001-04-03  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

	* gnuefi/reloc_ia32.c (_relocate): Change return type from "void"

	* gnuefi/crt0-efi-ia32.S (_start): Exit if _relocate() returns with
	non-zero exit status.

	* inc/ia32/efibind.h [__GNUC__]: Force 8-byte alignment for 64-bit
	types as that is what EFI appears to be expecting, despite the
	"#pragma pack()" at the beginning of the file!

2001-03-29  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

	* gnuefi/reloc_ia32.c: Add a couple of defines to work around
	libc/efilib collision on uint64_t et al.
	(_relocate): Use ELF32_R_TYPE() instead of ELFW(R_TYPE)().

	* gnuefi/crt0-efi-ia32.S (dummy): Add a dummy relocation entry.

2001-03-29  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

 	* Make.defaults (CFLAGS): Remove -nostdinc flags so we can pick
 	up the C compiler's stdarg.h.
 
 	* inc/stdarg.h: Remove this file.  It's not correct for gcc (nor
 	most other optimizing compilers).

2000-10-10  Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* cleaned up the error message and printing of those.
	* added support to load the FPSWA from a file in case support is not
	  present in the firmware already
	* fixed split_args() to do the right thing when you have leading spaces
	  before kernel name
	* changed the argify() function to rely on \0 instead of LoadOptionSize
	  as the field seems to be broken with current firmware
	* bumped version to 1.0

2000-10-04  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>
 
	* gnuefi/reloc_ia64.S: Reserve space for up to 750 function descriptors.

	* gnuefi/elf_ia64_efi.lds: Add .sdata section for small data and
	put __gp in the "middle" of it.

	* gnuefi/crt0-efi-ia64.S (_start): Use movl/add to load
	gp-relative addresses that could be out of the range of the addl
	offset.
	* gnuefi/reloc_ia64.S (_relocate): Ditto.

	* apps/Makefile: Remove standard rules and include Make.rules instead.
	* lilo/Makefile: Ditto.

	* added exit capability just before starting the kernel

2000-06-22  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

	* gnuefi/elf_ia64_efi.lds: Add .srodata, .ctors, .IA64.unwind,
	.IA64.unwind_info to .data section and .rela.ctors to .rela
	section.

2000-04-03  David Mosberger  <davidm@hpl.hp.com>

	* lilo/lilo.c (LILO_VERSION): Up version number to 0.9.

	* gnuefi/elf_ia64_efi.lds: Include .IA_64.unwind and
	.IA_64.unwind_info in .data segment to avoid EFI load error
	"ImageAddress: pointer outside of image" error due to the .dynsym
	relocations against these sections.

	* ChangeLog: Moved from lilo/ChangeLogs.

	* gnuefi/reloc_ia64.S: fixed typo: .space directive had constant
	100 hardcoded instead of using MAX_FUNCTION_DESCRIPTORS
	macro. Duh.

Fri Mar 17 15:19:18 PST 2000 Stephane Eranian <eranian@hpl.hp.com>

	* Released 0.8
	* replace the  getopt.c with new version free with better license
